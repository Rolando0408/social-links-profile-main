## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (implied by HSL colors)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I focused on structuring the HTML semantically and applying CSS for layout and styling. I practiced using Flexbox for centering content and managing the layout of the card. I also gained more experience with media queries to ensure responsiveness.

```css
body {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: center;
    min-height: 100vh;
    flex-direction: column;
}

.card {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue practicing responsive design techniques and exploring more advanced CSS features like Grid for more complex layouts. I also want to improve my JavaScript skills to add interactivity to future projects.
